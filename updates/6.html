	<p>Hello there,</p>

	<p>Here's what we have been doing in the previous two weeks:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>&ndash; First client project completed: subtitles for our friends at Xapo.com: <a href="https://twitter.com/xapo/status/492052116249120768">https://twitter.com/xapo/status/492052116249120768</a></li>
		<li>&ndash; Legally incorporated in the state of Ohio as a LLC.</li>
		<li>&ndash; Product: Algorithm to match new projects with available translators almost ready. Internal alpha test scheduled for next Monday.</li>
		<li>&ndash; Customer Acquisition: In talks with Roadtrippers.com to help them translate their content.</li>
		<li>&ndash; Brand: Brainstormed with Landor, a fantastic experience. Expecting first drafts on logo, typography and color scheme for next week.</li>
		<li>&ndash; Besides the marketplace, team is dedicating 10% of their time to investigate side initiatives, like a service that translates via email, and a service that analyzes the most visited pages of a site and translates only those.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Things are moving fast and we are all working focused on our deadline of 15 October (The Brandery Demo Day).</p>

	<p>Past updates can be seen here: <a href="http://www.keego.co/updates/">http://www.keego.co/updates/</a></p>

	<p>See you in two weeks,</p>

	<p>Best,</p>
