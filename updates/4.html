	<p>Hello there,</p>

	<p>Just a quick note to let you know that we are going to send a summary of our progress each month instead of each week. We think a month will provide more insights on the development of our company.</p>

	<p>For now, we can tell you that we are rolling out landing pages targeted to vertical markets (legal services, tourism), creating FB/Linkedin ads to test segments, and that we are in talks to close our first round of investment.</p>

	<p>Thanks,</p>

	<p>Rod</p>
