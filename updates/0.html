	<p>Hello there,</p>

	<p>I thought you might want to check what we did last week:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>&ndash; 160 new translators in the past 6 days (600+ new translators total signed up),</li>
		<li>&ndash; Sending new survey to get to know which of our translators are highly qualified and ready to work today (<a href="https://keego.typeform.com/to/FXAmth">https://keego.typeform.com/to/FXAmth</a>),</li>
		<li>&ndash; New landing page to roll out tomorrow, designed to reduce bounce rate (sneak peek: <a href="http://keego.co/t/">http://keego.co/t/</a>),</li>
		<li>&ndash; Focus on getting the first job between a client and a translator completed within the next 2 weeks,</li>
		<li>&ndash; Posted Craigslist test ad in the SFO category with good results: 104 visits, 56 conversions (53.85% of visits converted),</li>
		<li>&ndash; Implemented A/B testing for cold contacting translators via email. We are tracking conversions of these via Analytics too.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Thanks for reading,</p>

	<p>Best,</p>

	<p>Rod</p>
