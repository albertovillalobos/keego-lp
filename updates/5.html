	<p>Hello there,</p>

	<p>It's been a long time since our last update. So what we did?</p>

	<ul>
		<li>&ndash; We were invited to participate at The Brandery, a Top 10 US Accelerator: <a href="http://www.cincinnati.com/story/money/josh-pichler/2014/03/10/brandery-sxsw-seed-accelerator-ranking/6259563/">http://www.cincinnati.com/story/money/josh-pichler/2014/03/10/brandery-sxsw-seed-accelerator-ranking/6259563/</a>. The whole team relocated to Cincinnati to join the program.</li>
		<li>&ndash; We applied, were selected and pitched at the Rise of the Rest competition with Steve Case, co-founder of AOL (<a href="http://riseoftherest.com">riseoftherest.com</a>).</li>
		<li>&ndash; We are working with the world-known brand agency Landor (<a href="http://landor.com/">http://landor.com/</a>) on our branding, message and unique value proposition.</li>
		<li>&ndash; We had the first round of interviews with our mentors, including Rujul Zaparde of <a href="http://flightcar.com/">FlightCar</a>.</li>
		<li>&ndash; We are rolling our initial tests with enterprise clients.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>On a personal note: we are loving Cincinnati. The community is cozy, and made us feel at home from the day one.</p>

	<p>Have a great day,</p>

	<p>Rod &amp; the team @ Keego</p>
