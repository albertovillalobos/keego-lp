	<p>Hello there,</p>

	<p>Here's what we have been doing in the previous two weeks:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>&ndash; Clients: We completed a website translation project for Xapo. The process involved not only translating their content but delivering a ready to use site. Check it out here: <a href="http://clients.keego.co/xapo.com/en/">http://clients.keego.co/xapo.com/en/</a></li>
		<li>&ndash; Product: Algorithm to match new projects with available translators done and tested. Integration with PayPal scheduled for next week.</li>
		<li>&ndash; Product: Landing page design almost done.</li>
		<li>&ndash; Community: Pre-screened 15 translators. These are part of our initial group that is ready to start working in client's projects.</li>
		<li>&ndash; Business: Go to market strategy drafted, ideal customer identified.</li>
		<li>&ndash; Brand: Landor delivered us two options to pick from (1: <a href="http://cl.ly/image/0t1c2i383T3z">http://cl.ly/image/0t1c2i383T3z</a> 2: <a href="http://cl.ly/image/0u3d0v3Z0b21">http://cl.ly/image/0u3d0v3Z0b21</a>). Both are awesome and we had a hard time to pick one, but eventually decided to go with number one.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>It is fantastic to see how the company evolved from nothing to its first paid client. We are on our way to make something people not only wants, but it's willing to pay for. Thanks to our friends at Xapo por trusting us.</p>

	<p>See you in two weeks,</p>

	<p>Best,</p>

	<p>Rod</p>
